The LogBook project aims to ease the development process for Flex applications by allowing Flex  and pure actionscript logging messages to be sent to the AIR application via [LocalConnections](http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/flash/net/LocalConnection.html).

To see how to use the application with Flex projects, read the walkthrough at the [CIM blog](http://teamcim.comcast.net/team/flash/2008/02/the_logbook_cometh.html).

To see how to use LogBook with pure AS3 projects, see the entry [here](http://teamcim.comcast.net/team/flash/2008/04/logbook_now_for_pure_actionscr.html).

The LogBook is a project under active development and we will be releasing patches and updates in the coming months. If you want to get involved, get active on the [project's user group](http://groups.google.com/group/cimlogbook) or grab the [RSS feed](http://groups.google.com/group/cimlogbook/feed/atom_v1_0_msgs.xml) to add to your blog reader of choice.

If you have a feature you would wish to add to the project, talk about it on the group and add it to the issue tracker here with the label set to feature enhancement.

We are also looking for developers to contribute to the application either via patches/bugfixes or even additions to source code.
